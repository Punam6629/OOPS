        "1.  What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\" which can contain data and code to manipulate that data. OOP allows developers to structure software in a way that models real-world entities and their interactions. This approach promotes modularity, code reuse, and scalability in software development.\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP ?\n",
        "- In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a template that defines the methods and variables for a specific type of object:\n",
        "- Definition\n",
        "- A class is a user-defined data type that acts as a blueprint for creating objects.\n",
        "- Purpose\n",
        "- Classes are used to organize data so that programmers can reuse elements in multiple instances.\n",
        "- Structure\n",
        "- A class defines the shared aspects of objects created from it, such as state (variables) and behavior (methods).\n",
        "-Inheritance\n",
        "- Classes can have subclasses that inherit all or some of the characteristics of the class. The class that a subclass is based on is called the superclass.\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP ?\n",
        "- In object-oriented programming (OOP), an object is a fundamental unit of code that is a data structure with methods and fields:\n",
        "- Data: Fields, also known as properties, attributes, or members, contain data.\n",
        "- Methods: Subroutines or procedures that define how the object behaves in code.\n",
        "Class and Object in OOP - DEV Community\n",
        "- Objects are the basic building blocks of OOP applications. They are created using classes, which define their structure. Objects can interact with each other through defined interfaces.\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation ?\n",
        "- 1. Abstraction:\n",
        "- Definition:\n",
        "Abstraction focuses on hiding the implementation details of an object and exposing only the essential features or functionalities. It deals with the what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
        "- Purpose:\n",
        "To simplify the complexity of a system by only showing relevant information and hiding unnecessary details.\n",
        "- Implementation:\n",
        "Achieved using abstract classes, interfaces, or methods in languages like Java, Python, or C++.\n",
        "- Example:\n",
        "ATM Machine: You use an ATM to withdraw cash by pressing a few buttons. You don't need to know the internal workings of the machine, such as how it communicates with the bank server.\n",
        "2. Encapsulation:\n",
        "- Definition:\n",
        "Encapsulation is the mechanism of hiding an object's internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods. It protects the object's data from unauthorized access and modification.\n",
        "- Purpose:\n",
        "To achieve data security and prevent unintended interference.\n",
        "- Implementation:\n",
        "Achieved by using access modifiers such as private, protected, and public to control access to class members.\n",
        "- Example:\n",
        "Capsule in Medicine: The ingredients inside a capsule are hidden, and you only interact with it by consuming the outer shell.\n",
        "5.  What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder methods, short for \"double underscore methods,\" are special methods in Python that begin and end with double underscores (__). They are also known as \"magic methods\" or \"special methods.\" These methods enable the customization of the behavior of Python objects and provide hooks into Python's built-in features.\n",
        "- Dunder methods allow you to define how objects of a class interact with built-in functions, operators, and Python's syntax. For example, they can be used to customize string representation, arithmetic operations, comparisons, and more.\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "- Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class:\n",
        "- Explanation:\n",
        "A class that inherits from another class is called a subclass or derived class, while the class being inherited is called the parent class, superclass, or base class.\n",
        "- Benefits:\n",
        "Inheritance allows for code reuse, which minimizes redundancy and promotes efficient codebases. It also establishes a clear relationship between classes, which provides a structured approach to building and extending classes.\n",
        "- Examples:\n",
        "For example, a Strawberry class could inherit from a Fruit class, allowing it to use the Fruit class's public properties and methods. The Strawberry class could also add its own methods.\n",
        "- Some common types of inheritance include single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical, and hybrid inheritance.\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP ?\n",
        "- Polymorphism is a key concept in OOP that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class. It enables the same method or operation to behave differently depending on the object it is acting upon. The term \"polymorphism\" means \"many forms.\"\n",
        "8.  How is encapsulation achieved in Python ?\n",
        "- In Python, encapsulation is achieved by using access modifiers to limit access to a class's variables and methods:\n",
        "- Public:\n",
        "Attributes and methods are public by default, meaning they can be accessed from outside the class.\n",
        "- Private:\n",
        "Use a double underscore prefix (__) to make an attribute private. Private members are only accessible within the class and are intended for internal use.\n",
        "- Protected:\n",
        "Use a single underscore prefix (_) to indicate that an attribute is meant for internal use within the class and its subclass. Protected members are not as strictly enforced as private members.\n",
        "- Encapsulation is a programming technique that bundles a class's data and methods into a single unit. It helps to: Promote code reusability, Maintain code, Improve security, Reduce the risk of accidental data modification, and Make it easier to modify or extend functionality.\n",
        "- Python's encapsulation is convention-based, rather than strictly enforced by the language. However, adhering to these conventions is important for maintaining clean and maintainable code.\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python ?\n",
        "- In Python, a constructor is a special method that is automatically called when a new object is created from a class:\n",
        "- Purpose:\n",
        "The main purpose of a constructor is to initialize the attributes of an object when it is created.\n",
        "- Name:\n",
        "The name of the constructor method is always __init__.\n",
        "- How it works:\n",
        "The __init__ method is called with the newly created object as the first argument, and any additional arguments are passed to the class constructor. The self keyword can then be used to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
        "- Types of constructors:\n",
        "There are different types of constructors, including default constructors and parameterized constructors. A default constructor doesn't accept any arguments, while a parameterized constructor takes additional arguments from the programmer.\n",
        "- Importance:\n",
        "Constructors are a foundation of object-oriented programming and are important for streamlining object initialization and optimizing memory usage.\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- A . Class Methods\n",
        "A class method is a method that is bound to the class and not the instance of the class. It takes a class reference (cls) as its first argument instead of an instance reference (self), which allows it to modify class-level attributes rather than instance-level attributes.\n",
        "- Syntax: @classmethod decorator\n",
        "- Usage: Class methods are used when you need to operate on the class itself rather than an instance of the class, such as modifying class variables or creating factory methods.\n",
        "- B. Static Methods\n",
        "A static method is a method that does not take any special first argument (self or cls). It behaves like a regular function but belongs to the classâ€™s namespace. Static methods do not have access to the instance or the class, but they can still be called on the class or the instance.\n",
        "- Syntax: @staticmethod decorator\n",
        "- Usage: Static methods are useful when you want to include functionality that is related to the class but does not need to access or modify instance or class-level data.\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- Method Overloading is a feature in some object-oriented programming languages that allows multiple methods with the same name to be defined, each differing in the number or type of their arguments. However, Python does not natively support traditional method overloading like other languages such as Java or C++. In Python, the last method definition with the same name simply overrides the previous ones.\n",
        "However, you can simulate method overloading in Python by using default arguments or variable-length argument lists.\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- Method Overriding is a feature in OOP that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The new implementation in the subclass overrides the parent class method, which allows for more specific or customized behavior in the subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, the @property decorator is used to define a method as a getter for an attribute. It allows you to access a method like an attribute without explicitly calling it as a method. This helps in making the code more readable and is a way to implement encapsulation.\n",
        "- The @property decorator provides a getter for an attribute, and you can also define setter and deleter methods associated with that attribute.\n",
        "14.  Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism is a core feature of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages that allows for code reusability, flexibility, and extensibility. It's important because it allows programmers to:\n",
        "- Reuse code:\n",
        "Polymorphism allows programmers to reuse code, which saves time and speeds up development.\n",
        "- Improve readability :\n",
        "Polymorphism can improve code readability by allowing functions to share the same name but have different arguments.\n",
        "- Extend programs:\n",
        "Polymorphism makes it easier to extend or change aspects of programs without affecting the entire program.\n",
        "- Store multiple data types:\n",
        "Polymorphism allows all major data types to be stored in a single variable.\n",
        "- Simplify debugging:\n",
        "Polymorphism simplifies code debugging.\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to be subclassed by other classes. It serves as a blueprint for other classes. Abstract classes allow you to define methods that must be implemented by subclasses, ensuring that those subclasses follow a certain structure or contract.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Abstract classes are part of Python's abc (Abstract Base Classes) module, which provides the infrastructure for defining and working with abstract classes.\n",

        "- 1. Class Variables\n",
        "- Definition: A class variable is a variable that is shared among all instances of a class. It is defined within the class but outside any instance methods (including __init__).\n",
        "- Scope: Class variables belong to the class itself, not to any specific instance of the class.\n",
        "- Access: Class variables are accessed using the class name or through an instance, but the value is shared by all instances.\n",
        "- Modification: Any change to a class variable through one instance will affect all other instances of the class unless the variable is overridden at the instance level.\n",
        "- Example: Typically used for values or constants that should be the same across all instances of a class.\n",
        "2. Instance Variables\n",
        "- Definition: An instance variable is a variable that is specific to each instance of the class. It is defined inside methods (often in the __init__ constructor) and is prefixed with self to indicate it belongs to a particular object.\n",
        "- Scope: Instance variables belong to individual objects created from the class. Each instance of the class can have its own separate value for instance variables.\n",
        "- Access: Instance variables are accessed using the instance (not the class).\n",
        "Modification: Modifying an instance variable only affects the specific instance, not other instances of the class.\n",

        "- Multiple Inheritance in Python\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming where a class can inherit from more than one base class. This allows the derived class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes, combining their functionality.\n",
        "- In Python, a class can inherit from multiple classes by listing them in parentheses in the class definition. This feature enables a class to reuse code from more than one source, making it possible to create more complex and specialized behavior.\n",

        "- The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent (or superclass) class from within a derived (or subclass) class. It is a built-in function that allows you to invoke the methods of a superclass without explicitly naming the class, making the code more maintainable and avoiding direct reference to parent classes. This is particularly useful in cases of inheritance and multiple inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Significance of super()\n",
        "- Accessing Parent Class Methods:\n",
        "It allows a subclass to call methods from its superclass. This is especially useful in overriding methods, where you may want to extend or modify the functionality of a method defined in the superclass rather than completely replacing it.\n",
        "- Avoiding Hardcoding Parent Class Names:\n",
        "Using super() eliminates the need to explicitly mention the parent class's name. This makes your code more flexible and easier to maintain, especially when working with multiple inheritance, where a class may inherit from more than one parent.\n",
        "- Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Multiple Inheritance:\n",
        "In Python, when a class is derived from multiple classes, the Method Resolution Order (MRO) determines the order in which the classes are searched for a method. super() ensures that the method resolution follows the correct MRO, preventing conflicts and ambiguity.\n",

        "The __del__ method in Python is a special method (also called a dunder method) that is used to define the destructor behavior of an object. It is automatically invoked when an object is about to be destroyed, typically when it is garbage collected. The primary purpose of __del__ is to allow objects to perform clean-up activities such as closing files, releasing network connections, or other resources before the object is removed from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Significance of __del__ Method\n",
        "- Resource Cleanup:\n",
        "The __del__ method can be used to clean up external resources that the object may have acquired during its lifetime, such as files, database connections, or network sockets. This ensures that these resources are properly released when the object is no longer needed.\n",
        "- Automatic Invocation:\n",
        "Python automatically calls __del__ when an object is about to be garbage collected, i.e., when there are no more references to the object. This is a convenient way to perform cleanup without having to explicitly call a method from the user code.\n",
        "- Memory Management:\n",
        "Although Python uses automatic memory management with garbage collection, __del__ allows you to define how an object should release resources before it is destroyed. For example, it can be used to close files that were opened or free memory from external resources.\n",
